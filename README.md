### How Create Database

### How Create Database

This section explains how to configure your database connection using environment variables.

```text
# Set the database URL, which includes the connection string and file name for the SQLite database
DATABASE_URL=sqlite://app.db?mode=rw

# Set the database password (if applicable or needed for secure access)
DB_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
```

The above script sets up two environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Defines the SQLite database file (`app.db`) and opens it in `read-write` mode.
- `DB_PASSWORD`: A placeholder for your database password, ensuring secure access (if required by your setup).

Be sure to replace `mysecretpassword` with a strong and secure password for production systems.
```bash

sqlx db create 
```


### How To Migrate

```bash

sqlx migrate run
```

This will execute all the pending migrations defined in your migration files.```
